# Product Sales Analysis

## Aim
Analyzing the product sales in different territories and  predicting the sales and trends by exploratory data analysis, visualizations and machine learning.








## Approach
 

In the first stage of exploratory data analysis I'm cleaning the dataset and after that
I'm grouping the orders based on the city and the state .


It gives an insight of which products are popular in different cities and states.


Then I'm analyzing   the total sales  in different months to get the insight  how much products been sold in those months.

Then after that I'm plotting the months against the total sales of different products to get the inside of the 
product sales and trends in different months.
